# Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to Proposly! This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our browser extension and its associated website.

## 2. What Data We Collect

### Information you provide directly:
*   **Profile Data:** We collect information you provide in your profile, including but not limited to: your work experience, key skills, specialization, and other information necessary to generate personalized proposals.
*   **Data for Proposal Generation:** To perform the core function of the service, we process the text of the freelance job description that you highlight on a web page.
*   **Credentials:** When you register for an account, we collect your email address and a hashed password. If you use Google sign-in, we receive your email and basic Google profile information for authentication.

### Information collected automatically:
*   **Anonymous Usage Analytics:** We collect anonymous statistics about your interaction with the extension (e.g., number of successful generations, button clicks, feature activations). This data is not linked to your identity and is used solely to improve the product.

## 3. How and Why We Use Your Data
*   **For the core operation of the service:** Your profile data and the job description text are used to create a unique and relevant proposal using an AI model.
*   **For account management:** Your email is used for registration, authentication, access recovery, and sending service notifications (e.g., about the end of a trial period or subscription status).
*   **To improve Proposly:** Anonymous analytics help us understand how the service is used to make it more convenient and effective.

## 4. Who We Share Your Data With
We only share your data with third-party services (Sub-processors) that are necessary to provide and improve our services. Below are the categories of such services and the purposes for which we use them.

### Hosting and backend infrastructure
*   **Supabase:** We use Supabase as our primary backend platform. All your data, including your profile, credentials, and generation history, is securely stored and processed on Supabase servers. Supabase is used for user authentication, database storage, and file management.

### AI Content Generation
*   **OpenAI API:** To perform the core function of our service—generating proposal text—we send an anonymized dataset (your profile and the job description) to the OpenAI API. We do not transmit your personal information, such as your email.

### Analytics
*   We may use analytics services, such as **Google Analytics** or **Mixpanel**, to collect anonymous statistics about interaction with the extension (e.g., number of successful generations, button clicks, feature activations). This data is not linked to your identity and is used solely to improve the product. The data collected may include: `Trackers`, `Usage Data`.

### Handling payments
*   To process subscription payments, we may use third-party services like **Stripe**. In this case, we do not store your credit card information. The payment service receives the necessary information to process the payment directly. The data collected may include: `payment info` and other data as specified in the service's privacy policy.

### Managing contacts and sending messages
*   We may use services to send you service notifications (e.g., about the end of a trial period or subscription status). In this case, your `email address` will be shared with such a service.

## 5. Data Security and Storage
*   **Encryption:** All data transmission between your browser and our servers is protected by HTTPS/TLS encryption. Data stored in our database is encrypted at rest using the AES-256 algorithm.
*   **Data Isolation:** We use Row-Level Security (RLS) in our database. This measure ensures that each user has access only to their own data and technically cannot access the data of other users.
*   **Data Retention:** Your data is stored as long as you have an active account. Upon account deletion, all associated data will be deleted.

## 6. Your Rights
*   **Access and Editing:** You can view and edit your profile data at any time directly in the extension's interface.
*   **Data Deletion:** You have the right to delete your account and all associated data. To do so, please contact us at the address below.
